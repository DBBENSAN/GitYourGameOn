# **Description**

Our site provides users with information about upcoming NBA games and has a useful interface to find upcoming games and a link to the page at TicketMaster.com where tickets can be purchased.  Additionally, our site provides the user with the current season statistics of three of the top players on each team, for the game that they select.  Lastly, our site provides the user the ability to search a database provided by ballDontLie.io for player information and current season statistics.  

When our site is loaded into to a browser, a grid of NBA teams is presented.  The tiles, representing each of the 30 NBA teams are 'clickable', and when clicked, the user is presented with a list of 30 upcoming games for the selected team.  This list is dynamically generated through a fetch call to the TicketMaster.com (TM) API.  See below for an image of our home page.

Using the TM API, we are able to search events by NBA team.  This required us to use  selection critria, including the use of regx syntax to obtain the correct games form the TM API.  One challenge that we faced was that the string we had to search by, within the TM API data structure, for games that matched the user-selected team, varied in length and content.  For example, some games were listed in the TM API as "home team v away team", "home team vs. away team", "home team v. away team", or "home team vs away team". See below for image of the game listing page.

From the list of upcoming games presented, the user can select a specific game.  Upon the selection of a game, our JavaScript fetches data from an API of NBA statistics, BallDoneLie.io.  Noteworthy, is that we fetch the statistics of three top players for BOTH the team that our user selected and the opponent in the game that our user selected.  The user is then presented wth the statistics of current season statistics (average points, average rebounds, field goal percentage and assists).  On this page, after the user can review these statistics, the user can chose to select a link to TicketMaster.com, and suck link takes the user directly to the game for available tickets. See below for an image of this player statistics page.

Our site also provides the user the ability to search all other players in the NBA.  This is accomplished by the use of a pop up modal that prompts the user to select an NBA team from a drop down list, and enter a player name within a text box.  Upon the submission of this form, our site fetches the player information and current season averages for the selected player, if a player is found in the BallDontLie API. This information then presented in the modal.  The user can choose to save this player (in local storage).  See below for an image of the modal below.

Lastly, the user can use the "favorites" button on the navigation bar to view the previously saved players.

# **Testing User Acceptance** 

To test to ensure the code rendered the desired output I iterated a series of tests to ensure that all acceptance criteria were met and documented completion below:

1. WHEN I load the page I am presented with clickable boxes that correspond to the 30 NBA teams.  I also see three navigation buttons to search players, view favorite platers and home.

 - **Completed**.  The... 

2. WHEN I click a team I am presented with a list of upcoming games for my team with the opponent and the date of the game.  These games are clickable.

 - **Completed**.  The... 

3. WHEN I click a game, I am presented with the current season averages of three players on both the team I selected and the opponent.  I am also present with a clickable button that sends me to TicketMaster where I can purchase tickets to my selected game.  

 - **Completed**.  The....  

4. WHEN I view any page I see a navigation buttons for Home, Search Players and Favorites.  

 - **Completed**.  The ...  

5. WHEN i click the Home button I am directed back to the home page. 

 - **Completed**.  The   

6. WHEN I click the Search button a modal is displayed so I can select an NBA team and enter a player's name and hit submit.  When I hit submit, if a player is found in our API, player information and player statistics are displayed in the modal.  From there, I can also add the player and associated information and statistics to localStorage for retrieval later.  If a player is not found in our API, a message is displayed indicating so.

 - **Completed**.  The

7. WHEN i click the Favorites button I am directed to a page that has the players that I have searched previously, along with their information and statistics. 

 - **Completed**.  The
